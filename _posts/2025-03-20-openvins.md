## INITILIAZER
default, project runs with **static** initializer.  
For simplification, the dynamic initializer is deleted in the simplified project, if you want to learn the information,
please take a look at the original project and the sources provided below

1. **static initializer:**

This implementation that assumes that the imu starts from standing still.
To initialize from standstill:
- Collect all inertial measurements
- See if within the last window there was a jump in acceleration
- If the jump is past our threshold we should init (i.e. we have started moving)
- Use the *previous* window, which should have been stationary to initialize orientation
- Return a roll and pitch aligned with gravity and biases.

2. **Initializer for a dynamic visual-inertial system.**

This implementation that will try to recover the initial conditions of the system.
Additionally, we will try to recover the covariance of the system.

To initialize with arbitrary motion:

- Preintegrate our system to get the relative rotation change (biases assumed known)
- Construct linear system with features to recover velocity (solve with |g| constraint)
- Perform a large MLE with all calibration and recover the covariance.
Method is based on this work (see this [tech report](https://pgeneva.com/downloads/reports/tr_init.pdf) for a high level walk through):
