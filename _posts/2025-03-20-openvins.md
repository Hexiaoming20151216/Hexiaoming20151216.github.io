## INITILIAZER
* static initializer:
  * This implementation that assumes that the imu starts from standing still.
  * To initialize from standstill:
  * 1. Collect all inertial measurements
  * 2. See if within the last window there was a jump in acceleration
  * 3. If the jump is past our threshold we should init (i.e. we have started moving)
  * 4. Use the *previous* window, which should have been stationary to initialize orientation
  * 5. Return a roll and pitch aligned with gravity and biases.
